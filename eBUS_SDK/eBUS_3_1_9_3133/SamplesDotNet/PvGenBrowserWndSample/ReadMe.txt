Using PvGenBrowserWndSample
====================================

This C# sample shows how to use a PvGenBrowserWnd GenICam UI to control parameters.

1. Description

On the left you have a PvGenBrowserWnd that allows you controlling the communication parameters 
of a PvDevice object. These parameters can be accessed before connecting to a device.

You can connect to a device using the Select/Connect button. You are prompted with a 
PvDeviceFinderWnd dialog allowing you to select a GigE Vision device available on your network.

When connected to the PvDevice to a GigE Vision device, you can control the device parameters 
through its GenICam interface using the PvGenBrowserWnd on the right.
